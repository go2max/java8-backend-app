Terms you'll find helpful in completing today's challenge are outlined below, along with sample Java code (where appropriate).

2D Arrays
Also known as multidimensional arrays, they are very similar to the regular 1D Array data structure we've already discussed.

The following code:
int rowSize = 2;
int colSize = 4;
int[][] myArray = new int[rowSize][colSize];
creates a 2 Ã— 4 matrix where each element, (i,j), can be graphically represented as follows:
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
You may find it helpful to think of these (i,j) elements in terms of coordinates in an (x,y) graph or cells in a spreadsheet table.

To fill the array's cells with values, you can use a nested loop. The outer loop represents the matrix's rows and uses i as its variable, and the inner loop represents the matrix's columns and uses j as its variable. The code below assigns the value of count to each element in the 2D array we declared previously:
int count = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < rowSize; i++){
    for(int j = 0; j < colSize; j++, count++){
        myArray[i][j] = count;
    }
}
If we print the contents of each row:
for(int i = 0; i < rowSize; i++){
    for(int j = 0; j < colSize; j++){
        System.out.print(myArray[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
we'll see the following output:
0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7
