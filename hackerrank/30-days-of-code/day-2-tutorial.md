Terms you'll find helpful in completing today's challenge are outlined below, along with sample Java code (where appropriate).

Operators
These allow you to perform certain operations on your data. There are 3 basic types:
Unary: operates on 1 operand
Binary: operates on 2 operands
Ternary: operates on 3 operands

Arithmetic Operators
The binary operators used for arithmetic are as follows:
+: Additive
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Remainder (modulo)

Additional Operators
+: A binary operator used for String concatenation
++: This unary operator is used to preincrement (increment by 1 before use) when prepended to a variable name or postincrement (increment by 1 after use) when appended to a variable.
--: This unary operator is used to predecrement (decrement by 1 before use) when prepended to a variable name or postdecrement (decrement by 1 after use) when appended to a variable.
!: This unary operator means not (negation). It's used before a variable or logical expression that evaluates to true or false.
==: This binary operator is used to check the equality of 2 primitives.
!=: This binary operator is used to check the inequality of 2 primitives.
<, >, <=, >=: These are the respective binary operators for less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, and are used to compare two operands.
&&, ||: These are the respective binary operators used to perform logical AND and logical OR operations on two boolean (i.e.: true or false) statements.
? : This ternary operator is used for simple conditional statements (i.e.: if ? then : else).
