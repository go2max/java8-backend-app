# It must contain at least 33 digits (00 - 99).
# It should only contain alphanumeric characters (aa - zz, AA - ZZ & 00 - 99).
# No character should repeat.
# There must be exactly 1010 characters in a valid UID.
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases.
# The next TT lines contains an employee's UID.
