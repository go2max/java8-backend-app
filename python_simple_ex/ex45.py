# A certain childrens game involves starting with a word in a particular
# category. Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin
# with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given, it
# cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they
# fall out of the game. For example, with "animals" as the category,
# Child 1: dog
# Child 2: goldfish
# Child 1: hippopotamus
# Child 2: snake
# ...
# Your task in this exercise is as follows: Take the following selection of 70
# English Pokemon names (extracted from Wikipedia's list of Pokemon
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PokÃ©mon) and generate the/a sequence
# with the highest possible number of Pokemon names where the subsequent name
# starts with the final letter of the preceding name. No Pokemon name is
# to be repeated.
