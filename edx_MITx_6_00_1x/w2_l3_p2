In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some while loops.

1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

print 2
print 4
print 6
print 8
print 10
print Goodbye!

num = 2
while num <= 11:
    print num
    num += 2
print "Goodbye!"


2. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

print Hello!
print 10
print 8
print 6
print 4
print 2

print "Hello!"
num = 10
while num > 1:
    print num
    num -= 2


3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

21

which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable end. Our automating testing will provide a value of end for you - so write your code in the following box assuming end is already defined.

total = 0
while end > 0:
    #print end
    total += end
    end -= 1
print total
