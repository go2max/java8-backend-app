In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some for loops.

1. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

print 2
print 4
print 6
print 8
print 10
print "Goodbye!"

for num in range(2, 12, 2):
    print num
print "Goodbye!"


2. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

print "Hello!"
print 10
print 8
print 6
print 4
print 2

print "Hello!"
for num in range(10, 0, -2):
    print num

3. Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

21

which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable end. Our automating testing will provide a value of end for you - so write your code in the following box assuming end is already defined.

total = 0
for i in range(end+1):
    total += i
print total
