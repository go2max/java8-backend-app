For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string). While you could simply type these expressions into an IDLE or Canopy shell, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.

For decimal answers, give the full result, or at least four decimal places of accuracy (whichever is shortest).

In this class, we will be using Python 2.7 and not Python 3.0. Take a look at Problem Set 0 to see how to install a Python Integrated Development Environment, if you would like to start typing in the expressions in these and future exercises to see their result.
