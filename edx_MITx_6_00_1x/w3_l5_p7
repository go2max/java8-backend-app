For this problem, write a recursive function, lenRecur, which computes the length of an input argument (a string), by counting up the number of characters in the string.

def lenRecur(aStr):
    '''
    aStr: a string

    returns: int, the length of aStr
    '''
    # Your code here
    if aStr == "":
        return 0
    return 1+lenRecur(aStr[0:-1])
