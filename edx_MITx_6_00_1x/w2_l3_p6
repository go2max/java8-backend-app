Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated questions.

Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong.

iteration = 0
count = 0
while iteration < 5:
# the variable 'letter' in the loop stands for every
# character, including spaces and commas!
for letter in "hello, world":
    count += 1
print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)
iteration += 1

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 0?
12 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 1?
24 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 2?
36 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 3?
48 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 4?
60 - correct

iteration = 0
while iteration < 5:
count = 0
for letter in "hello, world":
    count += 1
print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)
iteration += 1

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 0?
12 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 1?
12 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 2?
12 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 3?
12 - correct

What is the value of the variable count that is printed out (at the print statement) on iteration 4?
12 - correct

iteration = 0
while iteration < 5:
count = 0
for letter in "hello, world":
    count += 1
    if iteration % 2 == 0:
        break
print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)
iteration += 1

How many times will the print statement be executed?
5 - correct

What is the largest value of the variable iteration that will be printed out (at the print statement)?
4 - correct

What is the largest value of the variable count that will be printed out (at the print statement)?
12 - correct

What is the smallest value of the variable count that will be printed out (at the print statement)?
1 - correct
