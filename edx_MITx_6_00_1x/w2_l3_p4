Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated question.

Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong.

This question is going to ask you what some simple loops print out. If you're asked what code like this prints:

num = 5
if num > 2:
print num
num -= 1
print num

write what it prints out, separating what appears on a new line by a comma and a space. So the answer for the above code would be:

5, 4

If a given loop will not terminate, write the phrase 'infinite loop' in the box.


num = 10
for num in range(5):
    print num
print num
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 - correct

divisor = 2
for num in range(0, 10, 2):
    print num/divisor
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 - correct

for variable in range(20):
    if variable % 4 == 0:
        print variable
    if variable % 16 == 0:
        print 'Foo!'
0, Foo!, 4, 8, 12, 16, Foo! - correct

for letter in 'hola':
    print letter
h, o, l, a - correct

count = 0
for letter in 'Snow!':
    print 'Letter # ' + str(count) + ' is ' + str(letter)
    count += 1
    break
print count
Letter # 0 is S, 1 - correct
