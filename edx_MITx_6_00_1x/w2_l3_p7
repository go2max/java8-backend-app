Here is the first sample of code from the previous problem:

Code Sample

iteration = 0
count = 0
while iteration < 5:
for letter in "hello, world":
    count += 1
print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)
iteration += 1

We wish to re-write the above code, but instead of nesting a for loop inside a while loop, we want to nest a while loop inside a for loop. Which of the following loops gives the same output as the Code Sample?

Try to answer the following questions by just reading the code. Reading code is a very good skill to have (and will help you both in your programming career and on your 6.00x exams!). It is okay to check your answers that you obtain from just reading the code, then in your interpreter run the code for the ones you got wrong on your first attempt.

Test 1

for iteration in range(5):
    count = 0
    while True:
        for letter in "hello, world":
            count += 1
        print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)

No

Test 2

for iteration in range(5):
    count = 0
    while True:
        for letter in "hello, world":
            count += 1
        print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)
        break

No

Test 3

count = 0
phrase = "hello, world"
for iteration in range(5):
    index = 0
    while index < len(phrase):
        count += 1
        index += 1
    print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)

Yes

Test 4

count = 0
phrase = "hello, world"
for iteration in range(5):
    while True:
        count += len(phrase)
        break
    print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)

Yes

Test 5

count = 0
phrase = "hello, world"
for iteration in range(5):
    count += len(phrase)
    print "Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count)

Yes
