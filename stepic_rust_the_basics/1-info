Rust

Welcome! This practical lesson is based on the Rust Book(https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/getting-started.html) and will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety and speed. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Featuring

    zero-cost abstractions
    move semantics
    guaranteed memory safety
    threads without data races
    trait-based generics
    pattern matching
    type inference
    minimal runtime
    efficient C bindings

Basics

This lesson contains gradable exercises on basic syntax and semantics of Rust. It has individual steps on each part of Rust's syntax.
