Did you ask clarifying questions (to your fictional interviewer) to help ensure that you were solving the problem the interviewer intended?

Did you work through an example before you started coding to ensure and communicate to your interviewer that you understood the question correctly?

Did you talk through your process continually while you were writing your code so that there were no long periods of silence and the "interviewer" could know your thought process?

Did you finish your coding task by tracing through an example to verify that your solution actually works?

Did you find and correct your mistakes as you wrote your code?
