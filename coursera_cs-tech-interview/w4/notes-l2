The first would be brand. And I think that this would be important for someone to focus on within their career, regardless of their demographic. But, for someone like myself, I think it's super important, right? And so, often, there will be opportunities, types of projects, areas of growth that I would have. And because I focused on my brand, I really empowered people to know who I was. What my goals were, what my strengths were, and where I wanted to go. I empowered folks that I worked with, with the opportunity to give me experiences, projects, exposure to different things I had not had in the past. I think the second thing that's super important, would be relationships. And so, that might be something that you might not have ever thought of initially but relationships are key, right. You work on, again, with the diversity of people on global teams sometimes. And it's really important that you know who's on your team. That you know the things that you may not necessarily consider super important. Ask about how their weekends were. Know who their family members are. Know about their hobbies. Know about what their personal and professional goals are. So that as you work together you can make sure those things are highlighted. I think the third thing is definitely technical excellence and having essential drive and ambition to learn. Technology is always changing and the stronger technically you are, on your team, the more value you can add towards building XYZ products.
